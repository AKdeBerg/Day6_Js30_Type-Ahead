## Tech I Used
This app is purely made with vanilla JavaScript & raw HTML/CSS. It is to demonstrate, if you can be creative you can make something amazing out of those core technologies.

Key topics-
+ **HTML:** I used HTML form and ul to show the results
+ **CSS:** I used quite a lot CSS properties here. Most of them are trivial but combining them in good order gave a nice look. I learned how to target odd and even child of an element, here, list element
+ **JS:** I used DOM manipulation technique to co-ordinate classes. Events that I used is mainly input

## Disclaimer
